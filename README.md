# **Plan Law Records or: My Plans for Pan Law Records**

<<<Note: This document is super incomplete and probably raises more questions than it answers.  I plan to fill things in and eventually turn it into a wiki that'll be hosted on the label's website>>>


So here's how I think I'm going to do things with the label (the idea is still in development, so this may change).

---

## The Default Deal

The default deal will be that I'll produce, engineer, mix, and master a track or collection of tracks for an artist (in this context, assume “artist” means artist or group).

These will be referred to as **PLOPs** (Pan Law Original Productions), which unlocks the ability for me to use the tagline:

> *"Can't flop if it's a PLOP!"*

From the moment the production is started, the artist is the legal owner of the recording. They're free to release the tracks any way they wish (Bandcamp, Spotify, physical, etc.).

As part of the deal, the artist grants me the rights to make the release freely available for the public good on the Internet Archive ([archive.org](https://archive.org)).

Unless the artist requests a variation, the release will be listed on the site with a **Creative Commons BY-NC-SA** license. This means that anyone can make derivatives of the artist's work (remixes, etc.) for personal or educational use, but if they want to release it publicly, they have to abide by these rules:

1. **BY (Attribution)** – They have to give the artist credit for their work.
2. **NC (NonCommercial)** – They're not allowed to monetize the derivative work (unless they work out a deal directly with the artist and are granted permission).
3. **SA (ShareAlike)** – Anyone who makes a derivative of their derivative work has to abide by the same rules.

## Bonus Features

At the very least, the raw multitrack files from the release's recording sessions will be included as a bonus feature.

Ideally, the bonus content will evolve and grow over time, possibly adding things like:

* alternate takes/mixes/masters
* DAW session files
* interviews
* "making of" documentaries
* sheet music/tab transcriptions

A longer-term goal of mine is to produce free educational materials on topics like audio production that use recordings/sessions from the label's catalog as examples.

In the event that the label grows to the point where I can't safely operate under the table and have to start running it like a real business, I'll probably separate the educational wing off into a nonprofit.

## The PLOP Fund

There will be a collection of donation links referred to as the **PLOP Fund**.

The donations will be used both to expand the label's capabilities and to compensate the artists and any other contributors for making the PLOPs.

---

## Contributor Units (CUs)

Any time a PLOP track is produced, a **CU** (Contributor Unit) is created. This is the unit used in the calculations to determine how much everyone gets paid.

* Tracks 60 seconds or longer generate **1 CU**.
* Tracks lasting 30–59 seconds generate **0.5 CUs**.
* Tracks under 30 seconds generate **0.25 CUs**.

Here's the default split for how a track's CU amount gets distributed:

* **50%** of the CU goes to the artist.
* **30%** gets reinvested into the label.
* **20%** goes to yours truly.

---

### Adding Contributors

In the event that we decide to bring on additional contributors to the project/track, their share of the CU can be deducted from any of the three main recipients, depending on how we agree to structure the deal.

**Example:**
I produce an album for an artist. We hire a local graphic designer, and they agree to do the work for **10% of each CU** from the album. The artist and I decide to deduct this equally from each of our personal shares. So in this case:

* 45% of each CU goes to the artist.
* 30% gets reinvested into the label.
* 15% goes to me.
* 10% goes to the graphic designer.

Initially, I'm going to be dumping my personal shares back into the label to accelerate development, so in the case of the above album, it would look like this:

* 45% of each CU goes to the artist.
* 45% gets reinvested into the label.
* 0% goes to me.
* 10% goes to the graphic designer.

---

## How Much Is a CU Worth?

That all depends entirely on how much money is in the PLOP Fund at the end of the quarter (I'll be doing payouts quarterly).

The formula for determining how much someone gets paid is:

```
(total CUs held by contributor / all-time total CUs generated) * PLOP Fund quarter-end total
```

---

### Example Calculation

Here's an example using the figures above if it were a 12-song album and all tracks had a duration greater than 60 seconds.

In this scenario, it's the only album the label has released so far, and the PLOP Fund has received **\$1000** by the end of Q1.

The payouts would be as follows:

| Recipient          | CUs                | Amount |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| Artist             | 0.45 (45% of 1 CU) | \$450  |
| Label Reinvestment | 0.45               | \$450  |
| Me                 | 0                  | \$0    |
| Graphic Designer   | 0.10               | \$100  |

This system is built to lift everyone up a bit if someone gains traction and drives more donations to the label.

## CU Longevity

Accumulated CUs will stay with the contributor for as long as the label exists.

If an artist decides to pull a release from the label later on, they forfeit the CUs earned from that release.

As time goes on and the label releases more PLOPs, more total CUs will be generated, thereby lowering the value of each individual CU.

In the unfortunate event that donations to the PLOP Fund don't scale with the growing catalog, it will become decreasingly lucrative to produce a PLOP.

Luckily, the artists would at least have the opportunity to monetize the recordings in other ways since it's a non-exclusive deal.

## Resilience to Low Revenue

I've designed the label to be able to operate with virtually zero revenue coming in, making it resilient to slow growth and even dormancy if needed:

* My recording setup is bare bones at the moment, but it's technically all I need to make kickass records for the rest of my life.
* My primary means of promotion/audience-building is the live videos I shoot and post to YouTube/Instagram. This has the added benefit of potentially exposing the artists to new people (what's good for Pan Law is good for everyone). This takes time/effort and costs me money for travel/cover charges, but I would likely be going to a lot of these shows for personal enjoyment anyway, so I'm okay with it.
* Eventually my camera or some of the recording equipment will break and need to be replaced, but none of that would be catastrophic enough to put the label under.
* The Internet Archive is a nonprofit that offers its service for free to the world, so it doesn't cost me anything to host the files for the PLOPs.
* I'm only going to need a static website for the label, which I can host for free on GitHub Pages. I could buy a custom domain, but that cost is pretty negligible.

## Current Plans for Reinvesting the Label's Portion of the PLOP Fund

*(Roughly in this order)*

* **Behringer ADA8200** to expand multitrack capabilities from 8 to 16 channels.
* **Rack case** for the audio interfaces (I'll be using my setup as a mobile recording rig to produce PLOPs in various locations).
* **Some sort of headphone monitoring solution** for the recording sessions (haven't decided on the specifics for this one yet).
* **Upgrade/expand the mic collection** a bit.
* **Upgrade mic stands.**
* **Upgrade camera** to a Canon C200 rig (along with lots of extra storage because 4K video is a motherfucker).
* This is the point where I'll start being able to categorize a portion of the label reinvestment funds as *"money we can afford to lose"*, which is the perfect time to start venturing into mass-produced physical media.

  * I can use this money to take on the risk of unsold inventory.
  * For example, I get 300 copies of a 7" EP pressed.
  * The artist (or any other Pan Law artist) can buy copies from me at cost for the duration that I still have inventory left.
  * For physical media, I'm only going to deal in wholesale with businesses, leaving the direct online/in-person retail market pretty much wide open for the artists.
* I'd also like to set aside money that would occasionally afford us the luxury of tracking PLOPs at **Loud and Clear Studios** to keep money circulating in the local creative economy.
* I eventually plan to dedicate myself to years of self-study, learning the various crafts involved in filmmaking. During this time, I'll be socking away a portion of the label reinvestment fund to eventually start **Pulldown Pictures**, the cinema wing of Pan Law Records.
